# Dataset
A big thank you to Antrixsh Gupta on kaggle for uploading [Prompt Engineering and Responses Datas](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antrixsh/prompt-engineering-and-responses-dataset). This dataset is used for simulating the responses to the messages that are inserted into the queues.

## About Dataset

This dataset is designed to explore the fascinating area of prompt engineering, specifically how different types of prompts can influence the generated text responses. Whether you're interested in natural language processing, conversational agents, or textual analysis, this dataset offers a rich resource for your investigations.

### Features:

1. Prompt: The textual prompt used for generating a response.
2. Prompt_Type: The category of the prompt, which can be a Question, Command, or Open-ended statement. 
3. Prompt_Length: The character length of the prompt. 
4. Response: The text generated in response to the prompt.

### Size and Format:

The dataset contains 5010 records and is approximately 705KB in size.
It is provided in CSV format for easy manipulation and analysis.

### Prompt Effectiveness: 
Study how different types of prompts yield different kinds of responses.

### Conversational Agents:
Train and evaluate dialogue systems to better understand user intents.

### Text Generation Models:
Analyze how various prompts affect the performance of text generation models like GPT-4.

### Sentiment Analysis:
Explore how the tone or sentiment of a prompt influences the tone or sentiment of the response.

### Academic Research:
Use the dataset for various NLP or social science research topics related to human-computer interaction, dialogue systems, or machine learning.
